CUDA without Bumblebee

You can use CUDA without bumblebee. All you need to do is ensure that the nvidia card is on:

 # tee /proc/acpi/bbswitch <<< ON

Now when you start a CUDA application it is going to automatically load all the necessary modules.

To turn off the nvidia card after using CUDA do:

 # rmmod nvidia_uvm
 # rmmod nvidia
 # tee /proc/acpi/bbswitch <<< OFF
